## Before you get started. üëà

This is not an exhaustive list of all career opportunities in tech. I have been in tech for over 20 years and I am still learning about new areas of technology that exist.

What this is intended to be is a gateway into the field of technology focusing on prominent technologies where I regularly see high demand (as of 2022). 

Hopefully these courses lead you to tech areas that are interesting and exciting to you and then you can deep dive on those topics yourself and pursue it.

This is also not just for people looking to get into tech. This is also a great resource for people who are already in tech and want to level up their tech career. I hope this can be a resource for you to take your career to the next level.

## How Do I Get Started? ‚ùì

Follow the path laid out below. Information Technology is a huge field with many different areas of expertise and opportunities for you to find something that speaks to you, makes you excited to learn, and provides an exciting path forward in your career.

## How Much Will It Cost? :free:

The path to getting a job can be, and there is no other way to say this.... 

**FREE**

That's right. If you have a reasonably good computer and an internet connection, the majority of resources listed here are free. Pick some topics that seem interesting, buckle down, and work through the courses.

Actually, that is not true. It isn't **FREE**. Your time has value, so this will cost you something. To really make this move, it is going to cost you your time.

If you commit about 10 hours a week for 1-2 years, I believe you can easily make over $100K/yr working remotely. Anywhere you have internet and your computer, you can do your job.

There are many paid resources that might be better organized, slightly higher quality, more in line with your learning style and maybe a more efficient use of your time, but these paid resources are optional. The web is filled with incredible, high quality, freely available educational resources that will provide you with all the knowledge you need to get a job in tech.

## Beyond The Free Courses How Much Should You Spend? üíµ  

As mentioned before, if you are being extremely frugal or just don't have the funds right now, free course are going to get you a *LONG* way into a solid tech education. But if you are able to pay and want to leverage those additional resources, how much *SHOULD* it cost?

Let's assume this is a 2 year journey for you and we can do some napkin math with optimal pricing and a broad learning path:

- One Year Coursera Google IT Support Certificates (and much much more): $39/month or $468/yr
- One Year ACloudGuru.com (Black Friday Discount Pricing): ~$300/yr
- Udemy Courses (Linux, Database, Python, More): Approx $15/course (almost always on sale) x 10 course = $150
- One Year Code With Mosh (Black Friday Discount Pricing): $125/yr

The breadth of knowledge you will get from these resources across general IT support, programming, cloud, Linux, containers and Kubernetes and more will easily put you in a 6 figure role for:

**$1024**.

That's right. For less than one months [average mortgage payment in the US](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/average-monthly-mortgage-payment/), you can completely change your career path and potential lifetime earnings.

## About Your Time üï•

Time is precious. It is a non renewable resource. Your time is finite. Protect it and spend it on things that improve your life and the life of those your care about.

You will have to give up some things. You will not be caught up on the latest Netflix series. You will not make it out to the bar with your friends every weekend. You will miss the season finale of "The Masked Singer". Your PS5 will get a bit dusty. But your life will be much improved for it.

*"I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion'"* - **Muhammad Ali** üí≠

## What Do You Need To Do To Make This A Reality? üëÄ

Commit. That's really it.

If you commit about 10 hours a week for 1-2 years, you can easily make over $100K/yr possibly working remotely. Imagine that life. Anywhere you have internet and your computer, you can do your job. 

Remote work isn't just "Work From Home". It's work while visiting your brother in Ohio. It's work from the pool or beach. It's work from another country. It is dropping your kid off at school, picking them up early and going to get ice cream.  It is spending more time with family and friends. The freedom tech work can provide is immense and well worth giving up little things now for big things later. 

*‚ÄúThe only person you can control is you. So focus on making yourself who you want to be: Faster. Stronger. Smarter. More humble. Less ego.‚Äù* ‚Äì **Jocko Willink** üí≠

Do not let this scare you. Take it slowly and learn individual components as they become necessary on your learning path.
